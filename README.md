| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
|[`/v1/payments`](#post-v1payments)                      | POST   |  creates a payment                 |
|[`/v1/payments/{paymentId}`](#get-v1paymentspaymentId)  | GET    |  returns a payment by ID           |



### POST /v1/payments

This endpoint creates a new payment.

#### Request example

```
POST /v1/payments
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "amount": 50000,
    "account_id": "32adf21bds3aac21",
    "return_url": "http://service.url/success/{paymentId}"
}
```

##### Request body description

| Field                    | required | Description                               |
| ------------------------ |:--------:| ----------------------------------------- |
| `amount`                 | X | Amount to pay in pence                           |
| `account_id`             | X | ID of the account to use for the payment         |
| `return_url`             | X | The URL where the user should be redirected to when the payment workflow is finished.         |

The value of field `return_url` needs to contain a placeholder for the payment-id. This is the literal string `{paymentId}`,
which will be replaced with the payment-id of the created payment resource when the user finishes the payment workflow
and is redirected back to the calling service.
