# pay-publicapi
GOV.UK Pay Public API service in Java (Dropwizard)

## Running in Development Mode

Steps are as follows:

1. Use a docker-compose environment to run everything (such as the database) that you don't want to develop on right now.
2. Stop `pay-publicapi` in the docker (`docker stop pay-publicapi`), to get ready to run from your checked out copy instead.
3. Because other services (inside or outside of docker) will try and talk to publicapi on dockerhost (not localhost), run the redirect script to send these requests to localhost.
4. Use `env.sh` to pick up the same environment variables from `pay-scripts`, so configuration is set correctly (this assumes `$WORKSPACE/pay-scripts` exists).

For example:

```
$ ./redirect.sh start
$ ./env.sh mvn exec:java
...
(pay-publicapi log output)
...
(press CTRL+C to stop service)
...
$ ./redirect.sh stop

### POST /v1/payments

This endpoint creates a new payment.

#### Request example

```
POST /v1/payments
Authorization: Bearer BEARER_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "amount": 50000,
    "description": "Payment description",
    "return_url": "http://service.url/success/{paymentId}"
}
```

##### Request description

BEARER_TOKEN: A valid bearer token for the account to associate the payment with.

| Field                    | required | Description                               |
| ------------------------ |:--------:| ----------------------------------------- |
| `amount`                 | X | Amount to pay in pence                           |
| `description`            | X | Payment description                              |
| `return_url`             | X | The URL where the user should be redirected to when the payment workflow is finished.         |

The value of field `return_url` needs to contain a placeholder for the payment-id. This is the literal string `{paymentId}`,
which will be replaced with the payment-id of the created payment resource when the user finishes the payment workflow
and is redirected back to the calling service.
